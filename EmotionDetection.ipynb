      "I'm just some rando on the internet not a financial advisor. I'm pretty risk averse but I like watching my money grow. the annual return of large indexes like the Dow (which is actually just an index of ~30 companies or so) or things of that nature is like 9-12%. Some times it's more, sometimes its less. but historically, on average, it's about that. you can get more return with more risk. I don't care for that, I'm happy to take minimum risk and get 11% return. Everyone has to decide what's best for them. I'll tell you one thing I beliege though. the average retailer isn't smart enough to outplay investment companies like Goldman Sachs who have mathematicians and statisticians out the ass mixed with data scientists who code highly advanced algorithms to game stop the market. If you're making investments based on a bunch, that's kinda risky imo. indexes spread risk it's as simple as that, and the returns are still good. you can get focused indexes too. like tech indexes which just gets you a piece of Google, Amazon, MSFT, etc all at once.\n",
